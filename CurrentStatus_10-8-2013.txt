Here is a summary of what has happened so far:

		*Initial team meeting
		*Over view of enitre project
		*Discussed desired simulation model
		*Discussed pros and cons of CarSim
		*Discussed possible user input interfaces
			(Logitech controllers, other driving wheels)

		*Researched development options and design.

		*Discussed use of Unity or other 3rd party graphics
			environments (i.e. Unreal) to develop visuals
			for simulation.
		*Wrote proposals for various for development direction:
			I: CarSim
				+ Realistic engine simulation
				- Does not allow for interaction, essentially removing prospect of any human-driven simulation
			II: SimuLink 3D
				+ Works natively w/ MatLab
				- Requires Licensing
				- Looks like crap
			III: Unity 3D
				+ Easy learning curve
				- Communication challenge b/w Unity + MatLab (solvable)
				+ Pretty

		*Discovered rFactor software that has been used in
			similar simulation research.
		*Proposed use of rFactor/rFactor Pro for development
		*Decided to use rFactor Pro (if a license is cheap
			enough, and commercial rFactor otherwise).
			9/27/2013
		*Decided to use Logitech G27 Force-Feedback racing wheel
			for user input and ordered it. 9/27/2013
		*Set up space in lab with computer and racing wheel
			for development and testing. 10/1/2013. (pictures on site)

		*Split focus of team into three areas:
			- Dirk: work on track design and creation
				with Brian.
			- Zach: work on vehicle model connections
				between rFactor and Matlab with Sukhuan.
			- Michael: Work on recieving user input in
				Matlab model with Sukhuan (either
				from rFactor, or directly from controller).

	
		*Discussed current state of rFactor
		*Decided to attempt using rFactor 2
			instead of rFactor Pro due to price tag




Need to do:
	* Get what we have of Matlab model connected to rFactor
		as proof of concept.
	* Complete a presentation for class (10/10/2013) and VW
	* Ask Dr. Ferris to inquire with VW whether or not they have
		any car simulation liscenses we can use.
	* Discuss clear requirements/deliverables with Dr. Ferris for
		THIS semester.
	* Purchase software to use for development (currently rFactor 2)
