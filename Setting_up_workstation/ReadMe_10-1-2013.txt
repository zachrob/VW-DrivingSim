After deciding on the Logitech G27 wheel and the rFactor (hopefully rFactor Pro) development
environment during the team meeting on Friday 9/27/2013, the G27 steering wheel was ordered.

It arrived Tuesday 10/1/2013, and the pictures within this folder are of our workstation setup
with the controller. It is also worth noting that the controller came (by chance) with a
commercial copy of the original rFactor program. This is useful, since we are still waiting 
to hear back from the rFactor Pro team about a liscense, and with the commercial rFactor
program, we can design at least a basic working prototype of our design.
