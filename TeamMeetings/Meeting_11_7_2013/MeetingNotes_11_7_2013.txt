- played with jostick input and connecting joystick input to vehicle model.
- updated vehicle model using joystick input (gas and brake).

- Discussed stretch goals
	- Head tracking
	- tachometer on dash

- Worked with existing example for Simulink 3D and modified the components so that we could replace their
	hardcoded input file with our vehicle model.
		- Removed unnecessary inputs/animations
		- discovered that we need a different format for vehicle rotation than the model delivers.
