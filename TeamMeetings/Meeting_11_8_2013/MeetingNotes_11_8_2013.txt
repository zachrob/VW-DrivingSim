- discussed data-mining .wrl track files for track data
	- would allow us to easily use premade tracks for basic testing
	- would allow us to only need to develop tracks once.

- Discussed next steps:
	- Updating vehicle model to properly handle steering wheel input.
	- Updating vehicle model to send rotation data in proper format.
	- Creating .wrl to track converting script.
	- Adding updated car model to 3D animation.
	- Modifying visual car model
		- add static wheels (removed from initial example, because they were animated independent
			of the car model, and we did not want to modify car model to provide needed
			values)
		- remove steering wheel (users will have physical wheel in front of them, virtual wheel unnecessary.
		- add red indicator light
		- add speedometer and desired graphs.
