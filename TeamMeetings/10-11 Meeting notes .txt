Meeting 10-11

Presentation outline
-Intro
	-Statistics
	-Crash/comparison video (?)
-Introduce the prevention system
	-Simulation
		-Next steps in our process
-Simulation
	-Matlab model
	-Carsim Videos
	-Realtime
	-Track Design/Scenario
		-Development system
		-Final design
	-Simulink 3d
	-Final crash video
	
Make sure to ask if they have their preferred simulator.

Zach works on the first slides, motivation for the project, statistics

Viewport design
	-Rearview at top of screen
	-Dashboard about 1/3 of the way from the bottom of the screen
		-Speedometer
		-rpm
		-performance margin (?) maybe only show afterwards
		-light to display if intervention strategy is working
	-Race display
		-Lap number
		-Last lap time
		-Best lap time
		
Show afterwards prediction vs reality

don't show user information about upcoming turns, we want the user to mess up in the simulation to help show off intervention strategy

Presentation deadline: Wednesday
	Dry run of presentation Wednesday, in conference room
	
Track design
features we're including
	Height differences that obscure turn (sharp turn after uphill)
	obstacle that obscures vision of upcoming road
	Decreasing radius turns
Design track by plotting x, y, z values
