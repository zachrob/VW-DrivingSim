- Finished basic straightway track
- Removed steering wheel from vehicle model and began planning static wheels
- Began planning possible speedometers.
- Set up design excercise for meeting on 15th.
- Hooked up modified math model to 3D animation.
- Successfully ran model on straightaway
	- issues with left/right motion
	- realized eventually that car model does not fully support left/right motion 
		or how it takes away from forward momentum.
	- Effectively car was "sliding on ice"
	- limited turn angle for now.
