Small meeting with only Michael, Zach, and Dirk.

    - Dirk worked on modeling points for track in MATLAB.

    - Zach worked with Simulink 3D examples to become familiar with Simulink and
        learn how to modify it.

    - Michael researched how to connect racing wheel input to Simulink, and worked
        with Zach on Simulink 3D examples.
