- Met with Josh Melson (Mathworks GTA) for direction on Simulink 3D
	- Determined that Simulink was not installed on current Machine,
		though MATLAB, Real-Time Windows Target, and Simulink 3D Animation were
	- Determined that no editing of Simulink 3D files could be done without Simulink
	- Discussed incorporating Driving wheel through Simulink Joystick input
	- Discussed rendering of tracks/terrain and importing renders into Simulink 3D Animation.

- Met with Dr. Ferris and Rebecca Brandy to briefly discuss current state of software on target Machine.
	- Installed liscensed versions of MATLAB/Simulink on target PC
	- Began discussion to get liscense for Simulink 3D animation (had been using trial
