Driving Simulator for Volkswagon
develop location aware intervention strategy to predict vehicle course to prevent accidents
ideally use real vehicle, attached to SIMULINK or other onboard computing, interacting with our intervention code
real vehicle not plausible at the moment, use CarSim (non-linear vehicle model)
need driver input
	throttle
	brake
	steering
	realistic interface
	REAL TIME
need VR environment
	racetrack?
	highway?
Look into gettin more people/equipment if necessary
Need to have a course that will showoff this intervention strategy, not just simple turns
	deer/pedestrian
