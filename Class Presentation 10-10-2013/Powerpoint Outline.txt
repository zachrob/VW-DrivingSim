Basic Outline of Presentation
	Single-vehicle accident statistics
		Large-scale statistics
		Small-scale individual cases
	"We can solve this with our system"
	Basic Explanation of system
		use road data to predict where problem areas are
		Predict where the car will be in 10 seconds
		adjust speed/other factors ahead of time to ensure that no accident occurs
	Video demonstration
	Plans
		working on getting the system working in a driving simulator
		hope to get it in an actual prototype vehicle within [timeline] and have it in production not long after.
